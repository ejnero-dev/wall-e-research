## 🌟 Subagent Philosophy

### Core Principles

**🚨 CRITICAL: NEVER DUPLICATE EXPERTISE**
- If a specialized subagent exists for a task, **always use it**
- Subagents bring years of accumulated knowledge and best practices
- Manual implementation should only be done when no relevant subagent exists

**🔗 COMBINE SUBAGENTS FOR COMPLEX FEATURES**
- Most advanced features require multiple subagents working together
- Plan subagent collaboration chains for optimal results
- Document which subagents were used and why

**📋 FOLLOW THE NATURAL FLOW**
- Some subagents naturally lead to others (devops → performance → monitoring)
- Respect the logical sequence of development phases
- Use subagent expertise to guide project architecture

### Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**❌ Manual Implementation When Subagent Exists**
```python
# WRONG: Manual security implementation
def basic_fraud_check(message):
    if "western union" in message.lower():
        return True
    
# CORRECT: Use security-compliance-auditor
# Advanced multi-layer fraud detection with 0% false negatives
```

**❌ Single Subagent for Complex Features**
```python
# WRONG: Only using one subagent for complex feature
# Only nlp-fraud-detector for AI feature
    
# CORRECT: Multi-subagent collaboration
# nlp-fraud-detector + performance-optimizer + test-automation-specialist
```

**❌ Ignoring Subagent Dependencies**
```python
# WRONG: Using devops-deploy-specialist without performance-optimizer
# May result in unoptimized production deployment

# CORRECT: Follow natural subagent flow
# performance-optimizer → devops-deploy-specialist → technical-documentation-writer
```
