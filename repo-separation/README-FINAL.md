# 🏗️ Wall-E Repository Separation Strategy - Implementation Guide

## 📋 Overview

This comprehensive repository separation strategy transforms the current `project-wall-e` repository into two distinct, purpose-built versions:

- **🔬 wall-e-research**: Educational/research version with full technical implementation
- **🏛️ wall-e-compliance**: Commercial-ready ethical version with strict compliance controls

## 🚀 Quick Start

Execute the scripts in order to implement the complete separation strategy:

```bash
# 1. Create repositories and initial structure
./scripts/01-create-repositories.sh

# 2. Set up Git workflows and branching strategies
./scripts/02-setup-git-workflow.sh

# 3. Configure CI/CD pipelines for both repositories
./scripts/03-setup-cicd.sh

# 4. Create deployment automation
./scripts/04-create-deployment.sh

# 5. Set up backup and synchronization
./scripts/05-setup-sync.sh

# 6. Install the sync system (run as root)
sudo ./scripts/install-sync-system.sh
```
